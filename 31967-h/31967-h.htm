<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Poetry</span> is the chosen language of childhood and
youth. The baby repeats words again and again for
the mere joy of their sound: the melody of nursery
rhymes gives a delight which is quite independent
of the meaning of the words. Not until youth approaches
maturity is there an equal pleasure in the
rounded periods of elegant prose. It is in childhood
therefore that the young mind should be stored with
poems whose rhythm will be a present delight and
whose beautiful thoughts will not lose their charm
in later years.</p>

<p>The selections for the lowest grades are addressed
primarily to the feeling for verbal beauty, the recognition
of which in the mind of the child is fundamental
to the plan of this work. The editors have
felt that the inclusion of critical notes in these little
books intended for elementary school children would
be not only superfluous, but, in the degree in which
critical comment drew the child's attention from the
text, subversive of the desired result. Nor are there
any notes on methods. The best way to teach children
to love a poem is to read it inspiringly to them.
The French say: "The ear is the pathway to the
heart." A poem should be so read that it will sing
itself in the hearts of the listening children.</p>

<p>In the brief biographies appended to the later books
the human element has been brought out. An effort
has been made to call attention to the education of
the poet and his equipment for his life work rather
than to the literary qualities of his style.</p>

<h3>The Owl and the Pussy-Cat</h3>

<div class='poem'>
The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a beautiful pea-green boat.</span><br />
They took some honey, and plenty of money<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wrapped up in a five-pound note.</span><br />
The Owl looked up to the moon above,      <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sang to a small guitar,</span><br />
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What a beautiful Pussy you are,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">You are;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What a beautiful Pussy you are!"       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
<br />
Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">How wonderful sweet you sing!</span><br />
Oh let us be married,&mdash;too long we have tarried,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But what shall we do for a ring?"</span><br />
They sailed away for a year and a day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the land where the Bong-tree grows,</span><br />
And there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a ring in the end of his nose,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">His nose;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a ring in the end of his nose.</span><br />
<br />
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your ring?" Said the piggy, "I will."       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
So they took it away, and were married next day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the turkey who lives on the hill.</span><br />
They dined upon mince and slices of quince,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which they ate with a runcible spoon,</span><br />
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They danced by the light of the moon,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">The moon;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They danced by the light of the moon.</span><br />

<h3>Wishing</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Ring ting! I wish I were a Primrose,<br />
A bright yellow Primrose, blowing in the spring!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stooping bough above me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wandering bee to love me,</span><br />
The fern and moss to creep across,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Elm-tree for our king!</span><br />
<br />
Nay,&mdash;stay! I wish I were an Elm-tree,<br />
A great lofty Elm-tree, with green leaves gay!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The winds would set them dancing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun and moonshine glance in,       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
And birds would house among the boughs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sweetly sing.</span><br />
<br />
Oh&mdash;no! I wish I were a Robin,&mdash;<br />
A Robin, or a little Wren, everywhere to go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through forest, field, or garden,       <span class='linenum'>15</span>     </span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ask no leave or pardon,</span><br />
Till winter comes with icy thumbs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To ruffle up our wing!</span><br />
<br />
Well,&mdash;tell! where should I fly to,<br />
Where go sleep in the dark wood or dell?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the day was over,       <span class='linenum'>5</span>     </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Home must come the rover,</span><br />
For mother's kiss,&mdash;sweeter this<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than any other thing.</span><br />

<h3>The Piper</h3>

<div class='poem3'>
Piping down the valleys wild,<br />
Piping songs of pleasant glee,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
On a cloud I saw a child,<br />
And he, laughing, said to me:<br />
<br />
"Pipe a song about a lamb."<br />
So I piped with merry cheer,<br />
"Piper, pipe that song again."   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>So I piped; he wept to hear.<br />
<br />
"Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe,<br />
Sing thy songs of happy cheer."<br />
So I sung the same again,<br />
While he wept with joy to hear.<br />
<br />
"Piper, sit thee down and write   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
In a book that all may read."<br />
So he vanish'd from my sight;<br />
And I pluck'd a hollow reed,<br />
<br />
And I made a rural pen,<br />
And I stain'd the water clear,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
And I wrote my happy songs<br />
Every child may joy to hear.<br />

<h3>A Year's Windfalls</h3>

<div class='poem'>
On the wind of January<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down flits the snow,</span><br />
Traveling from the frozen North   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">As cold as it can blow.</span><br />
Poor robin redbreast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look where he comes;</span><br />
Let him in to feel your fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And toss him of your crumbs.</span><br />
<br />
On the wind in February   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Snowflakes float still,</span><br />
Half inclined to turn to rain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nipping, dripping, chill.</span><br />
Then the thaws swell the streams,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And swollen rivers swell the sea:&mdash;       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
If the winter ever ends<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How pleasant it will be.</span><br />
<br />
In the wind of windy March<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The catkins drop down,</span><br />
Curly, caterpillar-like,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Curious green and brown.</span><br />
With concourse of nest-building birds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leaf-buds by the way,</span><br />
We begin to think of flower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And life and nuts some day.       <span class='linenum'>20</span>     </span><br />
<br />
With the gusts of April<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rich fruit-tree blossoms fall,</span><br />
On the hedged-in orchard-green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the southern wall.</span><br />
Apple trees and pear trees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shed petals white or pink,</span><br />
Plum trees and peach trees;   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While sharp showers sink and sink.</span><br />
<br />
Little brings the May breeze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside pure scent of flowers,</span><br />
While all things wax and nothing wanes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In lengthening daylight hours.       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
Across the hyacinth beds<br />

<h3>The Spring Walk</h3>

<div class='poem'>
We had a pleasant walk to-day<br />
Over the meadows and far away,<br />
Across the bridge by the water-mill,<br />
By the woodside and up the hill;<br />
And if you listen to what I say,<span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
I'll tell you what we saw to-day.<br />
<br />
Amid a hedge, where the first leaves<br />
Were peeping from their sheathes so sly,<br />
We saw four eggs within a nest,<br />
And they were blue as a summer sky.<span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
<br />
An elder branch dipped in the brook;<br />
We wondered why it moved, and found<br />
A silken-haired smooth water-rat<br />
Nibbling, and swimming round and round.<br />
<br />
Where daisies open'd to the sun,<span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>In a broad meadow, green and white,<br />
The lambs were racing eagerly&mdash;<br />
We never saw a prettier sight.<br />
<br />
We saw upon the shady banks<br />
Long rows of golden flowers shine,<br />
And first mistook for buttercups   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
The star-shaped yellow celandine.<br />
<br />
Anemones and primroses,<br />
And the blue violets of spring,<br />
We found, while listening by a hedge<br />
To hear a merry plowman sing.   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
<br />
And from the earth the plow turned up<br />
There came a sweet, refreshing smell,<br />
Such as the lily of the vale<br />
Sends forth from many a woodland dell.<br />
<br />
And leaning from the old stone bridge,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
Below, we saw our shadows lie;<br />
And through the gloomy arches watched<br />
The swift and fearless swallows fly.<br />
<br />
We heard the speckle-breasted lark<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>As it sang somewhere out of sight,   <span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
And tried to find it, but the sky<br />
Was filled with clouds of dazzling light.<br />
<br />
We saw young rabbits near the woods<br />
And heard the pheasant's wings go "whir";<br />
And then we saw a squirrel leap   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
From an old oak tree to a fir.<br />
<br />
We came back by the village fields,<br />
A pleasant walk it was across 'em,<br />
For all behind the houses lay<br />
The orchards red and white with blossom.   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
<br />
Were I to tell you all we saw,<br />
I'm sure that it would take me hours;<br />
For the whole landscape was alive<br />
With bees, and birds, and buds, and flowers.<br />

Down in a green and shady bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A modest violet grew,</span><br />
Its stalk was bent, it hung its head,<br />

<br />
And yet it was a lovely flower,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />

It might have graced a rosy bower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Instead of hiding there.</span><br />
<br />
Yet there it was content to bloom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In modest tints arrayed;       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
And there diffused its sweet perfume<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the silent shade.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This pretty flower to see,</span><br />

By the shining Big-Sea-Water,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,<br />
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.<br />
Dark behind it rose the forest,<br />
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,<br />
Rose the firs with cones upon them;   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
Bright before it beat the water,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Beat the clear and sunny water,<br />
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.<br />
There the wrinkled old Nokomis<br />
Nursed the little Hiawatha,<br />
Rocked him in his linden cradle,<br />
Bedded soft in moss and rushes,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
Safely bound with reindeer sinews;<br />
Stilled his fretful wail by saying,<br />
"Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee!"<br />
Lulled him into slumber, singing,<br />
"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
Who is this, that lights the wigwam?<br />
With his great eyes lights the wigwam?<br />
Ewa-yea! my little owlet!"<br />
Many things Nokomis taught him<br />
Of the stars that shine in heaven;   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,<br />
Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses;<br />
Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits,<br />
Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,<br />
Flaring far away to northward   <span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
In the frosty nights of Winter;<br />
Showed the broad white road in heaven,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,<br />
Running straight across the heavens,<br />
Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.<br />
At the door on summer evenings,<br />
Sat the little Hiawatha;<br />
Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
Heard the lapping of the water,<br />
Sounds of music, words of wonder;<br />
"Minne-wawa!" said the pine-trees,<br />
"Mudway-aushka!" said the water.<br />
Saw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
Flitting through the dusk of evening,<br />
With the twinkle of its candle<br />
Lighting up the brakes and bushes.<br />
And he sang the song of children,<br />
Sang the song Nokomis taught him:   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
"Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,<br />
Little, flitting, white-fire insect,<br />
Little, dancing, white-fire creature,<br />
Light me with your little candle,<br />
Ere upon my bed I lay me,   <span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!"<br />
Saw the moon rise from the water,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Rippling, rounding from the water,<br />
Saw the flecks and shadows on it,<br />
Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"<br />
And the good Nokomis answered:<br />
"Once a warrior, very angry,<br />
Seized his grandmother, and threw her   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
Up into the sky at midnight;<br />
Right against the moon he threw her;<br />
'Tis her body that you see there."<br />
Saw the rainbow in the heaven,<br />
In the eastern sky the rainbow,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"<br />
And the good Nokomis answered:<br />
"'Tis the heaven of flowers you see there:<br />
All the wild-flowers of the forest,<br />
All the lilies of the prairie,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
When on earth they fade and perish,<br />
Blossom in that heaven above us."<br />
When he heard the owls at midnight,<br />
Hooting, laughing in the forest,<br />
"What is that?" he cried in terror;   <span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
"What is that," he said, "Nokomis?"<br />
And the good Nokomis answered:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>"That is but the owl and owlet,<br />
Talking in their native language,<br />
Talking, scolding at each other."<br />
Then the little Hiawatha<br />
Learned of every bird its language,<br />
Learned their names and all their secrets,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
How they built their nests in summer,<br />
Where they hid themselves in winter,<br />
Talked with them whene'er he met them,<br />
Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens."<br />
Of all beasts he learned the language,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br />
How the beavers built their lodges,<br />
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,<br />
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,<br />
Why the rabbit was so timid,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
Talked with them whene'er he met them,<br />
Called them "Hiawatha's Brothers."<br />

<h3>Hiawatha's Sailing</h3>

<div class='poem'>
"Give me of your bark, O Birch Tree!<br />
Of your yellow bark, O Birch Tree!<br />
Growing by the rushing river,<br />
Tall and stately in the valley!<br />
I a light canoe will build me,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,<br />
That shall float upon the river,<br />
Like a yellow leaf in autumn,<br />
Like a yellow water lily!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lay aside your cloak, O Birch Tree!       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
Lay aside your white skin wrapper,<br />
For the summer time is coming,<br />
And the sun is warm in heaven,<br />
And you need no white skin wrapper!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus aloud cried Hiawatha       <span class='linenum'>15</span>     </span><br />
In the solitary forest,<br />
By the rushing Taquamenaw,<br />
When the birds were singing gaily,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>In the Moon of Leaves were singing,<br />
And the Sun, from sleep awaking,<br />
Started up and said, "Behold me!<br />
Geezis, the great Sun, behold me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the tree with all its branches</span><br />
Rustled in the breeze of morning,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
Saying, with a sigh of patience,<br />
"Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his knife the tree he girdled;</span><br />
Just beneath its lowest branches,<br />
Just above the roots, he cut it,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
Till the sap came oozing outward;<br />
Down the trunk, from top to bottom,<br />
Sheer he cleft the bark asunder,<br />
With a wooden wedge he raised it,<br />
Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!</span><br />
Of your strong and pliant branches,<br />
My canoe to make more steady,<br />
Make more strong and firm beneath me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the summit of the Cedar       <span class='linenum'>20</span>     </span><br />
Went a sound, a cry of horror,<br />
Went a murmur of resistance;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>But it whispered, bending downward,<br />
"Take my boughs, O Hiawatha!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down he hewed the boughs of cedar,</span><br />
Shaped them straightway to a framework,<br />
Like two bows he formed and shaped them,<br />
Like two bended bows together.   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!</span><br />
Of your fibrous roots, O Larch Tree!<br />
My canoe to bind together,<br />
So to bind the ends together<br />
That the water may not enter,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
That the river may not wet me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Larch with all its fibers,</span><br />
Shivered in the air of morning,<br />
Touched his forehead with its tassels,<br />
Said, with one long sigh of sorrow,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
"Take them all, O Hiawatha!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the earth he tore the fibers,</span><br />
Tore the tough roots of the Larch Tree,<br />
Closely sewed the bark together,<br />
Bound it closely to the framework.   <span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Give me of your balm, O Fir Tree!</span><br />
Of your balsam and your resin,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>So to close the seams together<br />
That the water may not enter,<br />
That the river may not wet me!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Fir Tree, tall and somber,</span><br />
Sobbed through all its robes of darkness,<br />
Rattled like a shore with pebbles,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
Answered wailing, answered weeping,<br />
"Take my balm, O Hiawatha!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he took the tears of balsam,</span><br />
Took the resin of the Fir Tree,<br />
Seamed therewith each seam and fissure,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
Made each crevice safe from water.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!</span><br />
All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog!<br />
I will make a necklace of them,<br />
Make a girdle for my beauty,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
And two stars to deck her bosom!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From a hollow tree the Hedgehog</span><br />
With his sleepy eyes looked at him,<br />
Shot his shining quills, like arrows,<br />
Saying, with a drowsy murmur,   <span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
Through the tangle of his whiskers,<br />
"Take my quills, O Hiawatha!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the ground the quills he gathered,</span><br />
All the little shining arrows,<br />
Stained them red and blue and yellow,<br />
With the juice of roots and berries;<br />
Into his canoe he wrought them,<br />
Round its waist a shining girdle,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
Round its bows a gleaming necklace,<br />
On its breast two stars resplendent.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus the Birch Canoe was builded,</span><br />
In the valley, by the river,<br />
In the bosom of the forest;   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
And the forest's life was in it,<br />
All its mystery and its magic,<br />
All the lightness of the birch tree,<br />
All the toughness of the cedar,<br />
All the larch's supple sinews;   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
And it floated on the river<br />
Like a yellow leaf in autumn,<br />
Like a yellow water lily.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Paddles none had Hiawatha,</span><br />
Paddles none he had or needed,   <span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
For his thoughts as paddles served him,<br />
And his wishes served to guide him;<br />
Swift or slow at will he glided,<br />
Veered to right or left at pleasure.<br />

<h3>The Magpie's Nest</h3>

<div class='poem'>
When the arts in their infancy were,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a fable of old 'tis expressed</span><br />
A wise magpie constructed that rare   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little house for young birds, called a nest.</span><br />
<br />
This was talked of the whole country round;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You might hear it on every bough sung;</span><br />
"Now no longer upon the rough ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will fond mothers brood over their young:</span><br />
<br />
"For the magpie with exquisite skill   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has invented a moss-covered cell</span><br />
Within which a whole family will<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the utmost security dwell."</span><br />
<br />
To her mate did each female bird say:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Let us fly to the magpie, my dear;       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
If she will but teach us the way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A nest we will build us up here.</span><br />
<br />
"It's a thing that's close arched overhead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a hole made to creep out and in;</span><br />
We, my bird, might make just such a bed   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we only knew how to begin."</span><br />
<br />
To the magpie soon all the birds went,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in modest terms made their request,</span><br />
That she would be pleased to consent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To teach them to build up a nest.</span><br />
<br />
She replied: "I will show you the way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So observe everything that I do:</span><br />
First, two sticks 'cross each other I lay&mdash;"   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To be sure," said the crow, "why I knew</span><br />
<br />
"It must be begun with two sticks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I thought that they crossed should be."</span><br />
Said the pie, "Then some straw and moss mix<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the way you now see done by me."       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
<br />
"Oh, yes, certainly," said the jackdaw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That must follow, of course, I have thought;</span><br />
Though I never before building saw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I guessed that without being taught."</span><br />
"More moss, more straw, and feathers, I place   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this manner," continued the pie.</span><br />
"Yes, no doubt, madam, that is the case;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though no builder myself, so thought I."</span><br />
<br />

<h3>The Sandman</h3>

<div class='poem4'>
The rosy clouds float overhead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun is going down;</span><br />
And now the sandman's gentle tread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes stealing through the town.</span><br />
"White sand, white sand," he softly cries,  <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as he shakes his hand,</span><br />
Straightway there lies on babies' eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His gift of shining sand.</span><br />
Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,<br />
As shuts the rose, they softly close, when he goes through the town,<span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
<br />
From sunny beaches far away&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yes, in another land&mdash;</span><br />
He gathers up at break of day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His store of shining sand.</span><br />
No tempests beat that shore remote,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">No ships may sail that way;</span><br />
His little boat alone may float<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within that lovely bay.</span><br />
Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,<br />
As shuts the rose, they softly close, when he goes through the town.<br />
<br />
He smiles to see the eyelids close    <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the happy eyes;</span><br />
And every child right well he knows,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, he is very wise!</span><br />
But if, as he goes through the land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A naughty baby cries,              &nbsp; &nbsp;  10</span><br />
His other hand takes dull gray sand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To close the wakeful eyes.</span><br />
Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,<br />
As shuts the rose, they softly close, when he goes through the town.<br />
<br />
So when you hear the sandman's song   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sound through the twilight sweet,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Be sure you do not keep him long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-waiting on the street.</span><br />
Lie softly down, dear little head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rest quiet, busy hands,</span><br />
Till, by your bed his good night said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He strews the shining sands.       <span class='linenum'>5</span>     </span><br />
Blue eyes, gray eyes, black eyes, and brown,<br />
As shuts the rose, they softly close, when he goes through the town.<br />

<br />
"Oh, tell me all, my Mary&mdash;    <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All, all that ever you know;</span><br />
For you must have seen the fairies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Last night on the Caldon-Low."</span><br />
<br />
"Then take me on your knee, mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And listen, mother of mine:       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
A hundred fairies danced last night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the harpers they were nine;</span><br />
<br />
"And merry was the glee of the harp-strings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their dancing feet so small;</span><br />
But, oh! the sound of their talking   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was merrier far than all!"</span><br />
<br />
"And what were the words, my Mary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That you did hear them say?"</span><br />
"I'll tell you all, my mother,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But let me have my way.       <span class='linenum'>20</span>     </span><br />
"And some they played with the water,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rolled it down the hill;</span><br />
'And this,' they said, 'shall speedily turn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The poor old miller's mill;</span><br />
<br />
"'For there has been no water   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ever since the first of May;</span><br />
And a busy man shall the miller be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the dawning of the day!</span><br />

"'Oh, the miller, how he will laugh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he sees the mill-dam rise!       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
The jolly old miller, how he will laugh<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the tears fill both his eyes!'</span><br />
<br />
"And some they seized the little winds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sounded over the hill,</span><br />
And each put a horn into his mouth,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blew so sharp and shrill:</span><br />
<br />
"'And there,' said they, 'the merry winds go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away from every horn;</span><br />
And those shall clear the mildew dank<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the blind old widow's corn:       <span class='linenum'>20</span>     </span><br />
"'Oh, the poor blind widow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though she has been blind so long,</span><br />
She'll be merry enough when the mildew's gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the corn stands stiff and strong!'</span><br />
<br />
"And some they brought the brown linseed,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flung it down from the Low:</span><br />
'And this,' said they, 'by the sunrise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the weaver's croft shall grow!</span><br />
<br />
"'Oh, the poor lame weaver!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How he will laugh outright        <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
When he sees his dwindling flax-field<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All full of flowers by night!'</span><br />
<br />
"And then up spoke a brownie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a long beard on his chin:</span><br />
'I have spun up all the tow,' said he,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />

A little sheet for Mary's bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And an apron for her mother.'</span><br />
<br />
"And with that I could not help but laugh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I laughed out loud and free;</span><br />
And then on top of the Caldon-Low   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was no one left but me.</span><br />
<br />
"And all on top of the Caldon-Low<br />

And nothing I saw but the mossy stones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That round about me lay.       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
<br />
"But, as I came down from the hill-top,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I heard, afar below,</span><br />
How busy the jolly miller was,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how merry the wheel did go.</span><br />
<br />
"And I peeped into the widow's field,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">All standing stiff and green!</span><br />
<br />
"And down by the weaver's croft I stole,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see if the flax were high;</span><br />
But I saw the weaver at his gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the good news in his eye!</span><br />
<br />
"Now this is all I heard, mother,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />

And the dark Norwegian pines have bowed as his fearful breath went past.<br />
With an unscorched wing he has hurried on, where the fires of Hecla glow<br />
On the darkly beautiful sky above and the ancient ice below.<br />
<br />
He comes,&mdash;he comes,&mdash;the Frost Spirit comes!&mdash;and the quiet lake shall feel   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
The torpid touch of his glazing breath, and ring to the skater's heel;<br />
And the streams which danced on the broken rocks, or sang to the leaning grass,<br />

Like a ghost in a chair,<br />
Always looking what I am about;   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />

On a heap<br />

He turned in his bed; she was there again!   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
On high<br />
In the sky,<br />

Said the Wind&mdash;"I will blow you out again."   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />

The Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew dim.<br />
"With my sledge<br />

If only I blow right fierce and grim,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />

<h2>CLEMENT C. MOORE</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">America</span>, 1779-1863</h4>


<h3>A Visit from St. Nicholas</h3>

<div class='poem4'>
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br />
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br />
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br />
And Mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,<br />
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.<br />
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />
Tore open the shatters and threw up the sash.<br />
The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,<br />
Gave a luster of midday to objects below;   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,<br />
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br />
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br />
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:<br />
"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen&mdash;<br />
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!<br />
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away, all!"<br />
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br />
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,<br />
So, up to the house-top the coursers they flew,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
With the sleigh full of toys&mdash;and St. Nicholas, too.<br />
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof<br />
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br />
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br />
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br />
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br />
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br />
His eyes how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br />
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;<br />
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.<br />
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br />
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;<br />
He had a broad face and a little round belly<br />
That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
He was chubby and plump&mdash;a right jolly old elf;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.<br />
A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head,<br />
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.<br />
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br />
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br />
And laying his finger aside of his nose,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.<br />
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br />
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;<br />
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br />
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />

<h3>Lucy Gray</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, when I crossed the wild,</span><br />
I chanced to see at break of day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The solitary child.</span><br />
<br />
No mate, no comrade, Lucy knew;   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She dwelt on a wide moor,&mdash;</span><br />
The sweetest thing that ever grew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside a human door!</span><br />
<br />
You yet may spy the fawn at play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hare upon the green;       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will never more be seen.</span><br />
<br />
"To-night will be a stormy night&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You to the town must go:</span><br />
And take a lantern, child, to light   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your mother through the snow."</span><br />
<br />
"That, father, will I gladly do:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis scarcely afternoon&mdash;</span><br />
The minster-clock has just struck two;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yonder is the moon."</span><br />
<br />
At this the father raised his hook,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And snapped a fagot-band;</span><br />
He plied his work;&mdash;and Lucy took<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lantern in her hand.</span><br />
<br />
Not blither is the mountain roe:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With many a wanton stroke       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
Her feet disperse the powdery snow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That rises up like smoke.</span><br />
<br />
The storm came on before its time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She wandered up and down;</span><br />
And many a hill did Lucy climb,   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never reached the town.</span><br />
<br />
The wretched parents all that night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went shouting far and wide;</span><br />
But there was neither sound nor sight<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To serve them for a guide.       <span class='linenum'>20</span>     </span><br />
At daybreak on a hill they stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That overlooked the moor;</span><br />
And thence they saw the bridge of wood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A furlong from their door.</span><br />
<br />
They wept&mdash;and, turning homeward, cried,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"In heaven we all shall meet!"</span><br />
When in the snow the mother spied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The print of Lucy's feet.</span><br />
<br />
Then downwards from the steep hill's edge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They tracked the footmarks small;       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
And through the broken hawthorn hedge,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by the low stone wall:</span><br />
<br />
And then an open field they crossed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The marks were still the same;</span><br />
They tracked them on, nor ever lost;   <span class='linenum'>15</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to the bridge they came.</span><br />
<br />
They follow from the snowy bank<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those footmarks, one by one,</span><br />
Into the middle of the plank;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And further there were none!       <span class='linenum'>20</span>     </span><br />
&mdash;Yet some maintain that to this day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She is a living child;</span><br />
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the lonesome wild.</span><br />
<br />
O'er rough and smooth she trips along.   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never looks behind;</span><br />
And sings a solitary song<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That whistles in the wind.</span><br />

And people upon you for thousands of miles?<br />
<br />
Ah, you are so great and I am so small,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
I hardly can think of you, world, at all;<br />
And yet, when I said my prayers to-day,<br />
A whisper within me seemed to say:<br />
"You are more than the earth, though you're such a dot;<br />
You can love and think, and the world cannot."   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />

Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sailed off in a wooden shoe&mdash;</span><br />
Sailed on a river of crystal light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into a sea of dew.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"Where are you going, and what do you wish?"       <span class='linenum'>10</span>     </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old moon asked the three.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"We have come to fish for the herring fish</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And Nod.       <span class='linenum'>5</span>     </span><br />
<br />
The old moon laughed and sang a song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they rocked in the wooden shoe,</span><br />
And the wind that sped them all night long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ruffled the waves of dew.</span><br />
The little stars were the herring fish   <span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lived in that beautiful sea&mdash;</span><br />
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never afeard are we";</span><br />

<br />
All night long their nets they threw<br />

It seems to chill you through and through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a strange and speechless fear.</span><br />
'Tis the voice of the night that broods outside   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />

That when the wind went wailing so<br />

And then, when I was snug in bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whither I had been sent,</span><br />
With the blankets pulled up round my head,   <span class='linenum'>5</span><br />
I'd think of what my mother'd said,<br />

And "Who's been bad to-day?" I'd ask<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the wind that hoarsely blew,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Yoooooooo!</span><br />

That this was true I must allow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll not believe it, though!       <span class='linenum'>15</span>     </span><br />
Yes, though I'm quite a model now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was not always so.</span><br />
And if you doubt what things I say,<br />

Suppose you ask, "Who has been bad?"<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
